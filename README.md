# k8s-web-hello

A simple Node.js service used for practicing Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployments.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – base application runtime  
- **Docker** – containerized application build  
- **Kubernetes** – deployment and orchestration (coming soon)  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipelines (coming soon)

## Run Locally (without Docker)

```bash
npm install
npm start
